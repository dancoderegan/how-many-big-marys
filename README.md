# Big Mary Weight Converter

The only weight converter you'll ever need.

This weight converter is my first foray into coding with JS, and my first project with the <a href="https://www.get-coding.ca/">Get Coding</a> program. As a newbie to the coding world, I primarily wanted to create something simple in order to build a solid foundation to grow on. I also think this project shows others a little bit about myself, mainly that I'm a little bit silly, and that I truly love Big Mary's.
My Big Mary weight converter includes a variety of features and concepts:

<ul>
    <li> HTML based page with basic JavaScript </li>
    <li> Number inputs & radio buttons with event listeners </li>
    <li> Displaying output with fixed decimal results </li>
    <li> Visual display of images matching the same number from JS output </li>
    <li> Having the impulse control to actually weigh and photgraph a Big Mary before eating it </li>
</ul>

Big thanks to my instructor <a href="https://github.com/jackharrhy">Jack</a> for all his support. Our mutual love of chicken sandwiches, and more importantly his disdain for pickles was the driving force behind this silly little creation.</li>
